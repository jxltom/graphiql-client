# graphiql-web

Web application for GraphiQL with any GraphQL backends and Bearer Authentication

## Getting Started

- View the online demo for [Github GraphQL API v4](https://developer.github.com/v4/) in [https://graphiql-web.herokuapp.com/](https://graphiql-web.herokuapp.com/).

- Or launch your own demo on a free Heroku instance. Note that you have to set the ```GRAPHQL_API_URL``` environment variable to point to your backend GraphQL API url. ```GRAPHQL_BEARER_TOKEN``` is also required if accessing your GraphQL API needs Bearer Authentication.
